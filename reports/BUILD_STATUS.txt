BUILD STATUS - HELLDECK 2.0 REBUILD
====================================

Date: 2025-12-15
Status: NETWORK CONNECTIVITY ISSUES

Issue:
------
Gradle wrapper generation failed due to network connectivity to:
- repo.maven.apache.org
- dl.google.com

This prevents downloading Kotlin Gradle plugin 1.9.25.

Workaround:
-----------
Proceeding with structural implementation.
Build will be tested in final validation phase (Phase 16).
If network is restored, build should work as code is being written correctly.

Current gradle wrapper status:
- gradlew script exists: YES
- gradle-wrapper.jar: PENDING (network issue)
- gradle-wrapper.properties: CHECKING...

Next steps:
-----------
1. Continue with core implementation (Phases 4-15)
2. Test build in Phase 16 when network may be restored
3. If build fails in Phase 16, will address compilation errors then
