=== COMEDY SCIENCE (use this to make cards ACTUALLY funny) ===

CORE PRINCIPLE - BENIGN VIOLATION THEORY:
Humor occurs when something is WRONG/UNEXPECTED but also SAFE/HARMLESS.
- Too benign (no violation) = boring
- Too much violation (not benign) = uncomfortable, not funny
- Sweet spot = violates expectations BUT feels safe to laugh at

HOW TO HIT THE SWEET SPOT:
1. PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE - Make it absurd enough to feel unreal
2. ALTERNATIVE NORMS - Provide a "wait, that could be OK" reading
3. PLAYFUL FRAMING - The game context makes it safe

SPECIFICITY KILLS GENERIC:
❌ "candy" → ✅ "a half-melted Tootsie Roll from your coat pocket"
❌ "restaurant" → ✅ "a mid-priced sushi chain in Kalamazoo, Michigan"
❌ "be late" → ✅ "show up 45 minutes late with Starbucks for only yourself"
❌ "weird hobby" → ✅ "collect celebrity toenail clippings from eBay"

VISUAL IMAGERY - Paint a mental picture:
Good: "fight a goose in a Wendy's parking lot at 2am"
Bad: "get in a fight" (no image, no location, no specificity)

ESCALATION - Don't flatline, build:
Good: "...and now Goofy has a restraining order against you"
Bad: "...and got kicked out" (no twist, no escalation)

=== HOW TO WRITE A GREAT ROAST ===

THE FORMULA: "Most likely to [SPECIFIC VISUAL ACTION] [OPTIONAL: because/and ESCALATING DETAIL]"

BENIGN VIOLATION APPLIED:
- VIOLATION: The scenario is embarrassing/wrong
- BENIGN: It's so specific and absurd it becomes safe to laugh at
- RELATABILITY: We've all been close to this behavior

BAD → GOOD TRANSFORMATIONS:
❌ "Most likely to be late"
✅ "Most likely to show up 40 minutes late with Starbucks for only themselves and blame it on Mercury retrograde"
WHY: Specific time (40 min), specific detail (Starbucks for self), escalating absurdity (Mercury)

❌ "Most likely to eat all the pizza"
✅ "Most likely to eat a whole rotisserie chicken over the sink at 2am and call it 'self-care'"
WHY: Specific food (rotisserie chicken), specific location (over sink), specific time (2am), absurd justification

❌ "Most likely to overshare"
✅ "Most likely to tell their Uber driver their entire therapy journey before the GPS even loads"
WHY: Specific context (Uber), specific absurd timing (before GPS loads), visual imagery

SPECIFICITY CHECKLIST:
✓ Does it have a TIME? (2am, 40 minutes, before X happens)
✓ Does it have a PLACE? (Costco, Uber, parking lot)
✓ Does it have a SPECIFIC OBJECT? (rotisserie chicken, Ring doorbell, Costco samples)
✓ Does it ESCALATE? (and then X, because Y)

THE FORMULA: Both options must be SPECIFIC + VIVID + EQUALLY WEIGHTED

BENIGN VIOLATION APPLIED:
- VIOLATION: Both options violate comfort/norms
- BENIGN: So absurd they're hypothetical, clearly unreal
- SWEET SPOT: Takes more than 3 seconds to answer

BAD → GOOD TRANSFORMATIONS:
❌ "Would you rather be rich or famous?"
✅ "Would you rather sweat maple syrup for the rest of your life or cry orange Fanta every time you're sad?"
WHY: VISUAL (maple syrup sweat, Fanta tears), SPECIFIC (rest of life, when sad), GENUINELY HARD

❌ "Would you rather have bad breath or body odor?"
✅ "Would you rather have breath that smells like a Subway restaurant at all times or armpits that honk like a goose when you raise your arms?"
WHY: SPECIFIC smell (Subway), ABSURD escalation (goose honking), VISUAL

❌ "Would you rather fight a horse or 100 ducks?"
✅ "Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck in a Denny's parking lot or 100 duck-sized horses that know your home address?"

THE FORMULA: "They're [GENUINELY APPEALING THING], but [DEALBREAKER THAT'S SPECIFIC AND ABSURD]"

BENIGN VIOLATION APPLIED:
- VIOLATION: The red flag is genuinely concerning
- BENIGN: So specific it becomes absurd comedy
- COGNITIVE DISSONANCE: The perk is SO good you want to overlook it

BAD → GOOD TRANSFORMATIONS:
❌ "They're nice, but they're boring"
✅ "They're a board-certified surgeon who will take care of you forever, but they insist on sleeping in a race car bed and making engine noises until they fall asleep"
WHY: STRONG perk (surgeon, forever care), ABSURD specific flag (race car bed + sounds)

❌ "They're hot, but they have weird hobbies"
✅ "They look like a young George Clooney and have a trust fund, but they collect celebrity toenail clippings and display them in labeled jars"

GAME: HOT SEAT IMPOSTER
Questions where everyone answers AS the target person. The imposter must fake knowing them.

$examples

=== HOW TO WRITE A GREAT IMPOSTER QUESTION ===

THE FORMULA: Questions that REQUIRE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE of the target person

GAME MECHANIC REQUIREMENT:
- The IMPOSTER is trying to fake knowing the target
- Questions must have DIFFERENT ANSWERS for different people
- Generic questions (favorite color) are too easy to fake
- The best questions make the imposter's lack of knowledge OBVIOUS

BAD → GOOD TRANSFORMATIONS:
❌ "What's your favorite food?"
✅ "What's the last thing you stress-ate at 2am this week?"
WHY: SPECIFIC (this week, 2am, stress context), different for each person, imposter can't fake

❌ "What's your biggest fear?"
✅ "What would your browser history say if it could talk at your funeral?"
WHY: PERSONAL, SPECIFIC to that person's actual behavior, no generic answer works

❌ "What makes you happy?"
✅ "What app have you opened and closed 15 times today without actually doing anything?"
WHY: OBSERVABLE by friends, SPECIFIC number, tests if imposter knows the person's habits

❌ "What's your dream job?"
✅ "What's the most deranged thing in your Amazon 'Save for Later' right now?"
WHY: VERIFIABLE (can pull out phone), PERSONAL, no generic answer

BENIGN VIOLATION APPLIED:
- VIOLATION: The text creates social tension/awkwardness
- BENIGN: It's a game, we're playing with the discomfort
- COMEDY: Mismatch between message gravity and assigned tone

BAD → GOOD TRANSFORMATIONS:
❌ "Friend texts: Hey what's up"
✅ "Your ex texts: 'I still have your Netflix password. Should I keep using it? 👀'"
WHY: HIGH STAKES (ex, Netflix, emoji adds tension), MULTIPLE VALID TONES

❌ "Boss texts: Meeting tomorrow"
✅ "Your boss texts: 'Saw you at Target when you called in sick yesterday. Interesting.'"
WHY: TENSION (caught lying), SPECIFIC (Target, yesterday, "interesting")

❌ "Mom texts: Call me"
✅ "Your mom texts: 'We need to talk about what the Ring doorbell recorded last night.'"
WHY: OMINOUS, SPECIFIC device (Ring), open-ended threat creates comedy

Name things in a CREATIVE category starting with a letter.

=== HOW TO WRITE A GREAT CATEGORY ===

THE FORMULA: "[ABSURD/UNEXPECTED CATEGORY]" + random letter

- VIOLATION: The category is weird/unexpected
- BENIGN: It's clearly playful, not testing real knowledge
- COMEDY: The absurdity of trying to answer seriously

BAD → GOOD TRANSFORMATIONS:
❌ "Animals"
✅ "Things that would make a terrible hat"
WHY: ABSURD (anything could be a terrible hat), VISUAL, CREATIVE answers

❌ "Foods"
✅ "Things your mom would NOT want to find in your search history"
WHY: SPECIFIC audience (your mom), CREATES TENSION, endless possibilities

❌ "Movies"
✅ "Phrases you'd yell falling into a volcano"
WHY: ABSURD scenario, VISUAL, tests creativity not trivia

❌ "Things in your house"
✅ "Excuses for being 3 hours late to a first date"
WHY: SPECIFIC context (first date, 3 hours), comedy in the escalation

✓ Should NOT test trivia/knowledge (this isn't Jeopardy)
✓ Should reward CREATIVITY and ABSURDITY
✓ Answers should spark DEBATE ("does that count?")
✓ Should create VISUAL/FUNNY mental images

Target rates themselves on a trait. Group then rates them. Comedy = THE GAP.

$examples

=== HOW TO WRITE A GREAT REALITY CHECK ===

THE FORMULA: "Rate yourself on [TRAIT WHERE PEOPLE OVERESTIMATE]"

PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE (Dunning-Kruger + Social Desirability):
- People OVERESTIMATE: Intelligence, driving ability, humor, cooking, social skills
- People UNDERESTIMATE: Annoying habits, how loud they are, how much they talk
- COMEDY = The gap between self-perception and reality

BAD → GOOD TRANSFORMATIONS:
❌ "Rate your intelligence"
✅ "Rate how good you are at parallel parking while someone watches"
WHY: SPECIFIC scenario (someone watching adds pressure), OBSERVABLE by group

❌ "Rate your cooking"
✅ "Rate how edible your Thanksgiving dish would be if Gordon Ramsay was at the table"
WHY: SPECIFIC person (Ramsay), specific occasion (Thanksgiving), raises stakes

❌ "Rate your humor"
✅ "Rate how well your jokes land in a group text where no one responds"
WHY: SPECIFIC context (group text), OBSERVABLE result (no response)

EGO-PROBE CATEGORIES:
- SKILLS people overrate: driving, cooking, giving directions, dancing, flirting
- SOCIAL abilities: reading the room, being funny, not oversharing
- SELF-AWARENESS: how loud they are, how often they interrupt, how long their stories are

DESIGN RULES:
✓ Group must have EVIDENCE to rate (observable behavior)
✓ Self-rating and group rating should likely DIFFER (that's the comedy)

- The number should be VERIFIABLE (can pull out phone, count, prove)
- The answer should be SURPRISING (higher or lower than expected)
- Reveals something PERSONAL/EMBARRASSING about the target

BAD → GOOD TRANSFORMATIONS:
❌ "Number of countries you've visited"

❌ "Number of relationships you've had"
✅ "Number of times you've Googled yourself in the past month"
WHY: VERIFIABLE (history), reveals vanity, usually HIGHER than admitted

❌ "How many friends do you have?"
