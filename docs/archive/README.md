# Historical Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical development documents that have been preserved for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Contents

The `history/` subfolder contains:

- **Session summaries** - Notes from previous development sessions
- **Delivery reports** - Historical release and delivery documentation
- **Planning documents** - Outdated plans and audits
- **Test execution logs** - Previous testing documentation
- **Build/fix trackers** - Historical build issue tracking

## Why Archived?

These documents were archived as of December 2024 because:

1. They contained outdated information about the system architecture
2. The card generation system was upgraded from template-based to LLM-powered
3. They created confusion about the current state of the system
4. The root directory needed to be cleaned for maintainability

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see:

- `/README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture
- `/docs/` folder - Current technical documentation

## Note

These files are preserved for historical reference only. They may contain outdated or incorrect information about the current system.
