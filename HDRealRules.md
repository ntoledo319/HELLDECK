# 1\. Roast Consensus 🎯

### How to Play:

1.  **The Prompt:** A roast card appears (e.g., _"Who would eat mayo straight from the jar?"_).
2.  **The Vote:** Everyone secretly picks one victim.
3.  **The Countdown:** 20 seconds to lock in your choice.
4.  **The Reveal:** All votes drop simultaneously.
5.  **The Roast:** Whoever got the most votes takes the heat.

### The Mechanics:

-   **Simultaneous Reveal:** No one sees votes until the timer hits zero. No bandwagoning.
-   **Majority Rules:** The person with the most votes is crowned the Mayo Goblin (or whatever the prompt was).
-   **Ties:** Rock-paper-scissors. Loser takes the roast.

### Scoring:

-   **Majority Pick:** +2 Points (you voted with the hive mind).
-   **Room Heat Bonus:** If 80%+ of the room agrees on one person, everyone who voted for them gets +1 bonus point.
-   **The Roasted:** No points. Just shame.

### The Vibe:

-   **Instant Judgment:** This is _Survivor_ tribal council but faster and meaner.
-   **No Mercy:** If you get picked, own it. Denying it makes it worse.
-   **The Quiet Killer:** Sometimes the person who _doesn't_ get votes is the most suspicious.

### Tips:

-   Vote fast. Overthinking kills the vibe.
-   Consider who would _actually_ do this, not who you want to roast.
-   If you get picked, lean into it. "Yeah, I would. What about it?"

# 2\. Confession or Cap 🤥

### How to Play:

1.  **The Confessor:** Someone is chosen and receives a potentially embarrassing prompt (e.g., _"Have you ever stalked an ex on social media for over an hour?"_).
2.  **The Claim:** The Confessor answers **TRUE** or **FALSE**.
3.  **The Jury:** Everyone else votes on whether they believe the Confessor.
4.  **The Truth:** The answer is revealed.

### The Twist:

-   **Confessor Wins:** If they fool the majority (everyone guessed wrong), they get +2 points.
-   **Voters Win:** If you correctly called the lie (or truth), you get +1 point.
-   **Room Heat Bonus:** If the _entire_ room agrees and gets it right, everyone gets +1 bonus.

### Card Archetypes:

-   **The "Everyone Has Done This":** Prompts so common that lying is pointless (_"Have you ever peed in a pool?"_).
-   **The "Oddly Specific":** Weird enough that it could be true (_"Have you ever cried during a car commercial?"_).
-   **The "Career Ender":** Dark confessions that make you question your friendships (_"Have you ever lied on a resume?"_).
-   **The "Humble Brag":** Confessions that sound bad but are actually flexes (_"Have you ever been kicked out of a country?"_).

### The Vibe:

-   **Poker Face Required:** The best liars don't flinch. The worst liars laugh immediately.
-   **Trust Issues:** After three rounds, you will never believe your friends again.
-   **The Tell:** Watch for nervous laughter, long pauses, or over-explaining. Liars talk too much.

### Scoring:

-   **Confessor (Successful Lie):** +2 Points.
-   **Voters (Correct Guess):** +1 Point.
-   **Room Heat (100% Agreement + Correct):** +1 Bonus to all voters.

### Tips:

-   **Sell the truth like a lie.** If it's true, act suspicious. People will think you're bluffing.
-   **Sell the lie like the truth.** Confidence is everything. Say it fast and move on.
-   **Study the person.** If they're a chronic oversharer, a "FALSE" answer is probably a lie.

# 3\. Poison Pitch 💀

### How to Play:

1.  **The Dilemma:** A "Would You Rather" card is drawn with two horrifying options (e.g., _"Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck OR 100 duck-sized horses?"_).
2.  **The Assignment:** One person is randomly assigned to defend **Option A**. Another person defends **Option B**.
3.  **The Pitch:** Each pitcher has 30 seconds to argue why their option is the _better_ choice.
4.  **The Vote:** The group votes for the most convincing argument (not the better option—the better _pitch_).

### The Rules:

-   **You Don't Choose Your Side:** The game assigns you the option. You might have to defend the indefensible.
-   **Humor Beats Logic:** A hilarious argument for a terrible option will beat a boring argument for a good option.
-   **No Cop-Outs:** You cannot say "both options suck." You must sell your poison like it's medicine.

### Card Types:

-   **The Physical Nightmare:** Painful, disgusting, or dangerous scenarios (_"Eat a live spider OR lick a subway pole"_).
-   **The Social Suicide:** Reputation-destroying choices (_"Drunk text your boss OR your ex"_).
-   **The Moral Dilemma:** Ethically questionable options (_"Steal from a charity OR lie under oath"_).
-   **The Absurd Hypothetical:** Scenarios so ridiculous that logic doesn't apply (_"Fight a bear with a spoon OR seduce a bear with poetry"_).

### The Vibe:

-   **Debate Club on Acid:** You are a lawyer defending a guilty client. Make it work.
-   **Embrace the Absurd:** The worse your option is, the funnier your pitch can be.
-   **Confidence is Key:** If you believe it, they'll believe it.

### Scoring:

-   **Winning Pitcher:** +2 Points (your argument won, regardless of how bad your option was).
-   **Losing Pitcher:** Nothing. You tried.

### Tips:

-   **Reframe the horror.** "Sure, 100 duck-sized horses sounds bad, but think of the _cuteness factor_."
-   **Attack the other option.** "You want to fight ONE horse-sized duck? That thing will _murder_ you."
-   **Use personal attacks.** "You think _you_ could handle a horse-sized duck? You can't even open a pickle jar."

# 4\. Fill-In Finisher ✍️

### How to Play:

1.  **The Judge:** Someone is the Judge. They draw a card with a two-part prompt (e.g., _"I got kicked out of Disney World for \_\_\_\_\_, and now I'm banned from \_\_\_\_\_."_).
2.  **The Setup:** The Judge reads the card aloud and fills in the **first blank** verbally (e.g., _"I got kicked out of Disney World for **punching Goofy**..."_).
3.  **The Punchline:** Everyone else has **60 seconds** to write down their answer for the **second blank** (e.g., _"...and now I'm banned from **all theme parks in North America**."_).
4.  **The Reading:** The Judge reads all anonymous responses aloud.
5.  **The Winner:** The Judge picks their favorite. That person wins the round.

### The Strategy:

-   **Write for the Judge:** If the Judge loves dark humor, go dark. If they love puns, go punny.
-   **Short and Punchy:** Long answers lose momentum. Keep it tight.
-   **Callback Humor:** Reference something that happened earlier in the game or an inside joke.

### Card Archetypes:

-   **The Crime Scene:** _"I got arrested for \_\_\_\_\_, and the cop said \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   **The Breakup:** _"I broke up with my ex because of \_\_\_\_\_, and now they're dating \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   **The Job Interview:** _"I didn't get the job because I mentioned \_\_\_\_\_, and the interviewer said \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   **The Family Dinner:** _"Thanksgiving was ruined when someone brought up \_\_\_\_\_, and Grandma said \_\_\_\_\_."_

### The Vibe:

-   **Cards Against Humanity Energy:** But with a twist—the Judge controls half the joke, so you're riffing off _their_ setup.
-   **Improv Comedy:** You're the "Yes, and..." to the Judge's premise.
-   **Tailored Chaos:** Every round feels different because the Judge's personality shapes the humor.

### Scoring:

-   **Winner:** +1 Point.
-   **Judge Role:** Rotates clockwise after each round.

### Tips:

-   **Read the room.** If the Judge is conservative, don't write "cocaine."
-   **Subvert expectations.** If the setup is dark, try a wholesome punchline. If the setup is innocent, go nuclear.
-   **Timing matters.** The funniest answer is often the one that makes the Judge laugh _while_ they're reading it aloud.

# 5\. Red Flag Rally 🚩

### How to Play:

1.  **The Scenario:** A dating card is revealed with a **Perk** and a **Red Flag** (e.g., _"They're a billionaire, BUT they collect toenail clippings."_).
2.  **The Defender:** Someone is randomly assigned to defend this person and argue why they're still dateable.
3.  **The Pitch:** The Defender has 45 seconds to make their case.
4.  **The Vote:** Everyone else votes **SMASH** (would date) or **PASS** (absolutely not).

### The Verdict:

-   **Defender Wins:** If the majority votes **SMASH**, the Defender gets +2 points.
-   **Defender Loses:** If the majority votes **PASS**, the Defender drinks/takes a penalty.

### Card Types:

-   **The Dealbreaker:** Red flags so horrifying that no perk can save it (_"They're a doctor, BUT they don't believe in washing hands."_).
-   **The Negotiable:** Red flags that are weird but manageable (_"They're hilarious, BUT they talk to their plants like children."_).
-   **The Trap:** The perk is so good that you _want_ to overlook the red flag (_"They own a private island, BUT they're in a cult."_).
-   **The Reverse:** The "perk" is questionable, and the "red flag" is actually worse (_"They're really into astrology, BUT they also think the Earth is flat."_).

### The Vibe:

-   **Desperate Dating Show:** You are the contestant on _The Bachelor_ trying to justify a terrible decision.
-   **Moral Flexibility:** How much are you willing to overlook for money, looks, or convenience?
-   **Group Roast:** Even if the Defender wins, the group will roast them for defending someone who "collects human teeth."

### Scoring:

-   **Defender (Majority SMASH):** +2 Points.
-   **Defender (Majority PASS):** Penalty/Drink.

### Tips:

-   **Downplay the red flag.** "Okay, yes, they collect toenails, but _everyone_ has a hobby."
-   **Emphasize the perk.** "They're a _billionaire_. You can afford therapy for the toenail thing."
-   **Use humor.** "Look, I've dated worse. At least they're _organized_ about their toenail collection."

# 6\. Hot Seat Imposter 🎭

### How to Play:

1.  **The Target:** Someone is selected as the "Target."
2.  **The Imposter:** Another person is secretly chosen to impersonate the Target.
3.  **The Questions:** The group asks 3-5 personal questions (e.g., _"What's your biggest fear?"_ or _"What's the last thing you Googled?"_).
4.  **The Performance:** The Imposter answers each question _as if they were the Target_, trying to sound convincing.
5.  **The Vote:** After all questions are answered, the group votes: **REAL** (they believe the Imposter) or **FAKE** (they see through the act).

### The Twist:

-   **The Target Stays Silent:** The real Target cannot speak during the questioning. They just watch the Imposter try to become them.
-   **Subtle Details Win:** The best Imposters don't exaggerate. They mimic speech patterns, inside jokes, and small quirks.

### Scoring:

-   **Imposter (Fools Majority):** +2 Points.
-   **Target (Group Sees Through It):** +1 Point.
-   **Voters (Correct Guess):** +1 Point each.

### Question Types:

-   **The Softball:** Easy questions that anyone could answer (_"What's your favorite food?"_).
-   **The Curveball:** Questions that require specific knowledge (_"What did you do last Tuesday?"_).
-   **The Trap:** Questions designed to expose the Imposter (_"What's the name of your childhood pet?"_).
-   **The Roast:** Questions that force the Imposter to insult the Target (_"What's your most embarrassing moment?"_).

### The Vibe:

-   **Identity Theft Simulator:** You are literally stealing someone's personality for 60 seconds.
-   **Paranoia:** The Target will never trust you again after you reveal their "secret fear of mayonnaise."
-   **Method Acting:** The best Imposters _become_ the Target. Posture, tone, even facial expressions matter.

### Tips:

-   **Study your friends.** Pay attention to how they talk, what they complain about, and their go-to stories.
-   **Commit fully.** If you hesitate, you're caught. Answer with confidence even if you're guessing.
-   **Use callbacks.** Reference something the Target mentioned earlier in the night to sell the illusion.

8.  **The Stoned Philosopher** (Slow, mind-blown, "Whoa dude")
9.  **The Paralyzingly Shy** (Stuttering, terrified, whispering)
10.  **The Used Car Salesman** (Sleazy, fast, high-pressure)
11.  **The Shakespearean Actor** (Over-enunciated, dramatic projection)
12.  **The Conspiracy Theorist** (Paranoid, whispering, "They are listening")

14.  **The Medieval Peasant** (Downtrodden, scared of plague)
15.  **The Bond Villain** (Calm, slow, expecting them to die)
16.  **The Manic Squirrel** (2x speed, twitchy, wide-eyed)
17.  **The Dying Breath** (Gasping, 5 seconds to live)

### Rules for Cards:

-   **Context:** Cards must simulate a notification popping up on a lock screen.
-   **Brevity:** The prompt must be short (1-2 sentences max) to allow for immediate reaction.
-   **Ambiguity:** The text should be open-ended enough that any Tone _could_ work, but most will be disastrous.
-   **Stakes:** Low stakes (grandma) or maximum stakes (FBI) only. No middle ground.

### Card Types:

-   **The "We Need To Talk":** Relationship terrors, exes reaching out, or "who is this girl" texts.
-   **The Corporate HR:** Bosses asking for quick calls, unexpected firing rumors, or accidental "reply all" disasters.
-   **The Family Tech Support:** Boomer parents asking how to delete the internet or posting inappropriate statuses.
-   **The Wrong Number:** Bizarre requests from strangers (drug deals, cryptic warnings) that you must handle.
-   **The Group Chat:** A chaotic thread where you are being roasted or asked to pick a side.

### The Vibe:

-   **Panic:** The feeling of staring at those three typing dots (...) for too long.
-   **Social Anxiety:** The game thrives on the discomfort of mismatched tones (e.g., using "Seductive Whisper" to reply to "Grandma is in the hospital").
-   **Fast Paced:** No time to think. Read, React, Send.

### Scoring:

-   **Success (Majority Vote):** +2 Points.
-   **Failure (Breaking Character):** -1 Point.
-   **Room Heat Bonus:** Perfect improvisation that makes the entire room lose it = +1 bonus.

### Tips:

-   **Consider context carefully, then ignore it if the Tone demands it.**
-   **Physicality helps.** Hold an imaginary phone, use facial expressions, commit to the bit.
-   **Sometimes the best reply is a voicemail** (if the Tone allows).

# 8\. Taboo Timer ⏱️

### How to Play:

1.  **The Guesser & The Clue-Giver:** Everyone splits into two roles. One person is the Clue-Giver, the rest are Guessers.
2.  **The Target Word:** The Clue-Giver draws a card with a target word (e.g., _"WEDDING"_).
3.  **The Forbidden Words:** The card lists 3-5 words the Clue-Giver **cannot say** (e.g., _"Bride, Groom, Ceremony, Ring, Dress"_).
4.  **The Clock:** 60 seconds on the timer. The Clue-Giver must describe the target word without using any forbidden words.
5.  **The Guess:** Guessers shout out answers. If someone guesses correctly, the Clue-Giver draws a new card and keeps going.

### The Penalty:

-   **Forbidden Word Spoken:** If the Clue-Giver accidentally says a forbidden word, the card is discarded and they lose 1 point.
-   **Buzzer Role:** One person acts as the "Buzzer" and listens carefully for slip-ups.

### Card Archetypes:

-   **The Obvious:** Words everyone knows, but the forbidden words make it nearly impossible (_"PIZZA" - Forbidden: Cheese, Italy, Slice, Delivery, Pepperoni_).
-   **The Abstract:** Concepts that are hard to describe (_"LOVE" - Forbidden: Heart, Feeling, Romance, Relationship, Emotion_).
-   **The Pop Culture:** References that require creative clues (_"HARRY POTTER" - Forbidden: Wizard, Magic, Hogwarts, Wand, Book_).
-   **The Oddly Specific:** Niche words that require lateral thinking (_"SPATULA" - Forbidden: Kitchen, Flip, Cook, Pancake, Utensil_).

### The Vibe:

-   **Pressure Cooker:** The timer is ticking, your brain is melting, and you just said "BRIDE" when describing a wedding.
-   **Synonym Hell:** You will learn how limited your vocabulary actually is.
-   **Team Chaos:** Guessers will shout the _forbidden words_ constantly, making the Clue-Giver paranoid.

### Scoring:

-   **+2 per successful guess** (within the 60-second window).
-   **\-1 for each forbidden word spoken.**
-   **Bonus:** If the team guesses 5+ words in one round, everyone gets +1 bonus point.

### Tips:

-   **Think of synonyms quickly.** "Wedding" becomes "the thing where two people sign a legal contract in fancy clothes."
-   **Use examples and analogies.** "It's like a birthday party, but someone cries and it costs $30,000."
-   **Stay calm under pressure.** Panicking makes you say the forbidden words faster.

# 9\. The Unifying Theory 📐

### How to Play:

1.  **The Trio:** A card is revealed displaying three completely unrelated items (e.g., _"A Catholic Priest, A Referee, A Zebra"_).
2.  **The Challenge:** The person must explain exactly why these three things are **The Same**.
3.  **The Logic:** You must find the single thread—no matter how thin, absurd, or dark—that connects all three.
4.  **The Delivery:** Present your "Unifying Theory" to the group.
5.  **The Vote:** The group decides if your theory holds water or if you're just rambling.

### The "Spice Level" Clause:

-   **Spice 1-3:** Connections should be clever, literal, or silly.
-   **Spice 4+ (The Danger Zone):** If the game is set to Spice Level 4 or higher, the connection **must** be inappropriate, sexual, politically incorrect, or morally bankrupt.
-   _Example (Spice 1):_ Priest/Ref/Zebra → "They all wear black and white."
-   _Example (Spice 5):_ Priest/Ref/Zebra → "If you see one running at you in the wild, you are about to be screwed."

### Card Archetypes:

-   **The "Visual Gag":** Three things that look vaguely similar but serve different purposes.
    -   _Ex:_ A Cucumber, The Eiffel Tower, A Sword.
-   **The "Social Hazard":** Three people/groups you never want to meet.
    -   _Ex:_ Your Ex, The IRS, A Magician.
-   **The "Impossible Reach":** Three things so distinct it seems impossible.
    -   _Ex:_ The Moon, A Ham Sandwich, 9/11.
-   **The "Setup":** Two innocent things and one terrible thing, forcing you to ruin the innocent things to make the connection work.

### The Vibe:

-   **Conspiracy Theorist:** You are the guy with the red string on the corkboard. _Everything is connected._
-   **Desperate Lawyer:** You know you are lying, but you have to sell it to the jury to survive.
-   **Corrupt Philosopher:** Finding deep, dark meanings in everyday objects.

### Scoring:

-   **+2 for the most convincing or hilarious Theory.**
-   **\-1 for stating a fact that only applies to two items** ("Two of them are alive"). It must apply to **all three**.

### Tips:

-   **Look for Verbs:** Focus on what the items _do_ (or what is done _to_ them) rather than what they _are_.
-   **Go Dark:** When in doubt, "They all eventually die" or "They can all be used as a weapon" are safe bets.
-   **Commit:** If you pause, the theory falls apart. Speed sells the lie.

# 10\. Title Fight 🥊

### How to Play:

1.  **The Ambush:** You draw a card. Immediately point at someone else and yell **"FIGHT!"**
2.  **The Challenge:** Read the challenge on the card aloud (e.g., _"Category: Pizza Toppings"_).
3.  **The Clash:** You and that person compete instantly. No countdowns, no warm-ups.
4.  **The End:** The first person to mess up, pause, or quit is the Loser.

### The 3 Ways to Fight:

#### **The Brain (Categories):**

-   **Action:** Ping-pong answers back and forth rapidly. The card sets the topic.
-   **Losing Condition:** If you repeat an answer, stutter, or pause for more than 3 seconds, you lose.
-   **Example:** _"Names of Harry Potter characters."_ (You → Them → You → Them...)

#### **The Body (Speed):**

-   **Action:** A physical race to complete a simple task.
-   **Losing Condition:** Being second place.
-   **Example:** _"First person to touch a doorknob wins."_

#### **The Soul (Guts):**

-   **Action:** A test of willpower or awkwardness.
-   **Losing Condition:** Breaking eye contact, laughing, or flinching.
-   **Example:** _"Staring contest. You cannot blink or smile."_

### Scoring:

-   **Winner:** +1 Point (and bragging rights).
-   **Loser:** -1 Point (and takes the penalty/drink).

### Tips:

-   **Pick Your Victim Wisely:** If the card is a staring contest, don't pick the person with the glassy, unblinking eyes.
-   **Be Loud:** If you shout your answer with confidence, people might not notice it was wrong.
-   **Referees:** The people not fighting are the judges. If they say you paused too long, you lose. No arguments.

# 11\. Alibi Drop 🕵️

### How to Play:

1.  **The Crime:** Draw a card that accuses you of a specific scenario (e.g., _"Why is your search history just 'how to hide a body'?"_).
2.  **The Evidence:** The card lists **3 Mandatory Words** (e.g., _Pineapple, Tinder, Spatula_).
3.  **The Alibi:** You have 30 seconds to explain yourself. You must weave all three words into your story naturally.
4.  **The Verdict:** After you finish, the group acts as the Jury.

-   **Phase 1 (Believability):** Was the story convincing? If it was nonsense, you are **Guilty**.
-   **Phase 2 (The Catch):** The group tries to guess your 3 Mandatory Words. If they correctly identify the words you hid, you are **Guilty**.

### To Win:

You must tell a smooth story _AND_ fool the group so they can't tell which words were forced.

### Card Examples:

-   **The Suspicious Package:** _"What is in this bag you're trying to sneak onto the plane?"_
    -   _Hidden Words:_ A hamster, Glitter, The Declaration of Independence.
-   **The Missing Person:** _"Where were you the night your boss disappeared?"_
    -   _Hidden Words:_ Zumba Class, A Chainsaw, Gluten-free Bread.

### Scoring:

-   **Innocent (Success):** +2 Points. (Story was good AND the group failed to guess your words).
-   **Guilty (Failure):** -1 Point/Penalty. (The story made no sense OR the group caught your words).

### Tips:

-   **Don't Emphasize:** If you say "And then I picked up a... uh... _SPATULA_," you will get caught immediately. Say it casually.
-   **Use Decoys:** Throw in other random, weird nouns (that aren't on the card) to confuse the Jury.
-   **Speed Kills:** Speaking faster makes it harder for the Jury to flag specific words.

# 12\. Reality Check 🪞

### The Concept:

A brutal game of self-awareness. Someone rates themselves on a specific trait, and the group rates them on the same trait. If the numbers don't match, you are either **Delusional** or **Fishing**.

### How to Play:

1.  **The Question:** The active person (The Subject) draws a card with a specific trait (e.g., _"How funny are you, really?"_).
2.  **The Ego Score:** The Subject _secretly_ writes down a rating from **1 to 10** based on how they view themselves.
3.  **The Reality Score:** Simultaneously, the rest of the group discusses aloud and agrees on a single rating (1-10) for The Subject.
4.  **The Reveal:** Both numbers are revealed at the same time.

### The Verdict (Scoring):

-   **Self-Aware (Gap is 0-1):** The scores match! You know exactly who you are. **(+2 Points)**.
-   **Delusional (Ego is Higher):** You think you are a 9, but the group thinks you are a 4. You are living in a fantasy world. **(The Group Roasts You + You Drink)**.
-   **The Fisher (Ego is Lower):** You wrote a 4, but the group thinks you are an 8. You are obviously just fishing for compliments. We hate that. **(The Group Boos You + You Drink)**.

### Card Examples:

-   **The Fighter:** _"Rating: Your ability to win a bar fight against a random stranger."_
-   **The Lover:** _"Rating: Your performance in the bedroom."_
-   **The Survivor:** _"Rating: How long you would last in a zombie apocalypse before crying."_
-   **The Liar:** _"Rating: How convincing you are when you lie to your parents."_

### The Vibe:

-   **No Pity:** If someone underrates themselves ("The Fisher"), do not hug them. Accuse them of being a "Pick-Me" who just wanted to hear nice things.
-   **Loud Debate:** The group _must_ discuss the rating in front of the Subject (_"He thinks he's a 7? No way, remember the time he tripped over his own cat? He's a 3."_).
-   **The "Perfect 10":** If someone rates themselves a 10 and the group rates them a 1, they must finish their drink immediately. This is a **Critical Delusion**.

# 13\. Scatterblast 💣

### The Concept:

A high-speed category elimination game. The phone acts as a bomb with a hidden timer. The "Turn" moves around the circle, but the phone stays put.

### How to Play:

1.  **The Setup:** Place the phone in the center of the table (or assign a "Host" to hold it).
2.  **The Trigger:** A card reveals a **Category** + **Letter** (e.g., _"Celebrities" + "J"_).
3.  **The Fuse:** The timer starts (invisible duration: 20s - 60s).
4.  **The Relay:**

-   Player 1 shouts a valid answer (_"Jennifer Aniston!"_).
-   The Host (or Player 1) taps the **"Next"** button on the screen.
-   The "Turn" instantly passes to the person on the left.
-   Player 2 must shout a new answer (_"Jack Black!"_) and the button is tapped again.

5.  **The Explosion:** If the bomb sound plays while it is _your_ turn to speak, you lose.

### The "Challenge" Rule:

If someone shouts a nonsense answer or repeats a word, the group yells **"LOCKED!"** The Host _does not_ tap the button. The current person keeps the turn and must come up with a _new_ answer while the timer burns down.

### Card Variations:

-   **Standard:** Category + Start Letter.
-   **The Chain:** Last letter = First letter. (Apple → Elephant → Tiger).
-   **No Repeats:** Just the Category (no letter constraint), but you cannot repeat an answer ever used in previous rounds.

### The Vibe:

-   **Spectator Sport:** Since you aren't physically fumbling with a phone, you can focus entirely on staring at the victim and counting the seconds.
-   **Host Power:** If you are the Host, you control the button. If someone mumbles, don't tap it. Make them enunciate. Be a tyrant.

### Scoring:

-   **The Casualty:** The person whose turn it was when the bomb exploded takes the Penalty.
-   **The Survivors:** Everyone else is safe.

### Tips:

-   **Short Words:** "Job" is faster to say than "Justin Timberlake." Speed is everything.
-   **Don't Freeze:** Even a bad answer that gets Challenged is better than silence. It buys you a second to think.
-   **Anticipate:** Don't wait for your turn to think. Have your word ready while the person before you is stuttering.

# 14\. Over / Under 📉

### The Concept:

A social betting game. Someone is put on the spot with a question that has a specific number answer. The group sets a "Betting Line," and everyone gambles on whether the actual number is Higher (Over) or Lower (Under).

### How to Play:

1.  **The Subject:** Someone is chosen (The Subject).
2.  **The Stat:** A card is drawn asking for a number regarding The Subject (e.g., _"Total number of photos in their Camera Roll"_).
3.  **The Line:** The group briefly discusses and agrees on a "Line" (e.g., _"We think he's vain, but not crazy... let's set the line at 1,500"_).
4.  **The Bet:** Everyone (except The Subject) votes:

-   **OVER 🔼** (The real number is higher).
-   **UNDER 🔽** (The real number is lower).

5.  **The Receipt:** The Subject _immediately_ checks their phone or answers truthfully to reveal the exact number.

### The Payoff:

-   **Winners:** Those who bet correctly get +1 Point.
-   **Losers:** Those who bet wrong take a Penalty/Drink.
-   **Exact Match:** If the number is _exactly_ the Line, everyone drinks except The Subject (who is essentially a god).

### Card Archetypes:

#### **Digital Dirt (Phone Checks):**

-   _"Number of unread emails."_
-   _"Number of alarms currently set."_
-   _"Screen time usage for yesterday (in minutes)."_
-   _"Number of matches on their dating app (if single)."_

#### **The Past (History):**

-   _"Body Count (sexual partners)."_ _(High risk, high reward)_.
-   _"Age they had their first kiss."_
-   _"Number of times they've been arrested/detained."_

#### **The Hypothetical (Capabilities):**

-   _"How many push-ups can they do right now?"_ (Subject must perform).
-   _"How much cash is in their wallet right now?"_
-   _"How many state capitals can they name in 60 seconds?"_

### The Vibe:

-   **The Roast is in the Line:** The funniest part is setting the number. _"How many exes? Let's set the line at 12.5... wait, 12 is too low, remember 2019?"_
-   **The Tension:** Watching someone open their settings menu to check "Screen Time" while half the room prays for "Over" is genuinely electric.
-   **Instant Fact-Checking:** Unlike other games where you can lie, the phone doesn't lie.

### Scoring:

-   **Standard:** +1 for winning the bet.
-   **The House:** The Subject gets points equal to the number of people who guessed wrong (rewarding them for being unpredictable).

### Tips:

-   **Set the Line correctly:** A good Line splits the room 50/50. If everyone bets "Over," the Line was too low.
-   **The "Price is Right" Rule:** If you are setting the Line, try to be as accurate as possible to make the betting hard.
-   **Don't Lie:** The fun dies if The Subject lies about "Body Count" or "Unread Texts." Honor system (or phone proof) is mandatory.

# AI CARD GENERATION MASTER GUIDE

## Introduction: The Science of Social Friction

This section is the blueprint for generating cards that create **maximum social chaos with minimum cognitive load**. Every card must pass the **"Drunk Person Test"**: Can someone who's three drinks in understand this immediately and want to play?

The secret to addictive party games isn't complexity—it's **emotional leverage**. Cards must tap into:

-   **Ego** (How do I look to others?)
-   **Status** (Who's winning the social hierarchy?)
-   **Secrets** (What are we hiding?)
-   **Judgment** (Who's getting roasted?)

### The Universal Card Principles:

1.  **Brevity is King:** If a card requires more than 10 seconds to read, it's too long.
2.  **Ambiguity Creates Chaos:** The best cards have multiple valid interpretations.
3.  **Stakes Must Be Clear:** People need to know immediately what they're risking (reputation, points, dignity).
4.  **Relatability Wins:** Inside jokes are great, but universal human experiences are better.
5.  **The Roast Must Land:** Cards should make people laugh _at_ someone, not feel genuinely hurt.

## Game 1: Roast Consensus - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Roast Prompts** - Questions that force the group to collectively judge one person based on a specific behavior or trait.

### The Formula:

`"Who would [EMBARRASSING/WEIRD BEHAVIOR]?"`

### The Psychology:

These cards work because they exploit **social proof** (everyone's voting, so it must be true) and **public accountability** (you can't hide from a unanimous vote). The best prompts are things people have _definitely_ done but would never admit to in normal conversation.

### Card Categories:

#### **The Gross-Out:**

Bodily functions, hygiene failures, and disgusting habits.

-   _"Who would eat food off the floor after the 5-second rule expired?"_
-   _"Who would wear the same underwear two days in a row?"_
-   _"Who would smell their own armpit in public?"_

**Why it works:** Everyone has done these things. The humor comes from being publicly called out.

#### **The Social Failure:**

Awkward behaviors, cringe moments, and embarrassing tendencies.

-   _"Who would accidentally like their ex's Instagram post from 3 years ago?"_
-   _"Who would laugh at a funeral?"_
-   _"Who would wave back at someone who wasn't waving at them?"_

**Why it works:** These are universally relatable moments of social death. The roast is gentle but effective.

#### **The Secret Shame:**

Private behaviors people do when they think no one's watching.

-   _"Who would talk to their pet like it's a human baby?"_
-   _"Who would practice arguments in the shower?"_
-   _"Who would Google themselves regularly?"_

**Why it works:** These cards expose the gap between public persona and private reality.

#### **The Chaos Agent:**

Behaviors that suggest someone is unhinged or unpredictable.

-   _"Who would fight a goose and lose?"_
-   _"Who would get banned from a Costco?"_
-   _"Who would accidentally start a cult?"_

**Why it works:** Absurdist humor. The scenarios are ridiculous, but the group will still find the "most likely" person.

#### **The Low-Key Psychopath:**

Behaviors that are technically legal but morally questionable.

-   _"Who would eat pizza with a fork and knife?"_
-   _"Who would put ketchup on a steak?"_
-   _"Who would microwave fish in the office?"_

**Why it works:** These are "crimes against humanity" that reveal someone's true character.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Keep it PG-13 to R-rated.** Avoid anything genuinely offensive (racism, sexism, ableism).
-   **Make it visual.** The best prompts create a mental image (e.g., "Who would get stuck in a baby swing?").
-   **Avoid niche references.** "Who would main Kirby in Smash Bros?" only works if everyone plays Smash.
-   **Test for universality.** If the prompt only applies to 1-2 people in a group of 8, it's too specific.

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"Who would forget their anniversary?"_ (Too serious, not funny)
-   ❌ _"Who would cheat on a test?"_ (Too judgmental, kills the vibe)
-   ❌ _"Who would vote for \[political candidate\]?"_ (Too divisive, ruins friendships)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"Who would get catfished by a bot?"_ (Funny, relatable, harmless)
-   ✅ _"Who would cry during a Pixar movie?"_ (Wholesome roast, everyone's done it)
-   ✅ _"Who would lose a fight to a raccoon?"_ (Absurd, visual, hilarious)

## Game 2: Confession or Cap - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Confession Prompts** - "Have you ever..." questions that are embarrassing enough to lie about but common enough to be believable.

### The Formula:

`"Have you ever [EMBARRASSING ACTION]?"`

### The Psychology:

This game thrives on **plausible deniability**. The best prompts are things that are:

1.  **Common enough** that saying "yes" is believable.
2.  **Embarrassing enough** that saying "no" is also believable.
3.  **Specific enough** to create a mental image.

The goal is to make the Confessor squirm regardless of their answer.

### Card Categories:

#### **The "Everyone Has Done This":**

Confessions so universal that lying is pointless.

-   _"Have you ever peed in the shower?"_
-   _"Have you ever pretended to be asleep to avoid a conversation?"_
-   _"Have you ever Googled yourself?"_

**Why it works:** If someone says "no," they're obviously lying, which is funny. If they say "yes," they're admitting to something mildly embarrassing.

#### **The "Oddly Specific":**

Confessions that are weird enough to be memorable but common enough to be plausible.

-   _"Have you ever cried during a car commercial?"_
-   _"Have you ever practiced a conversation in the mirror?"_
-   _"Have you ever pretended to know a song you'd never heard before?"_

**Why it works:** These are specific enough to feel personal but vague enough that anyone could have done them.

#### **The "Career Ender":**

Confessions that are genuinely questionable but not illegal.

-   _"Have you ever lied on a resume?"_
-   _"Have you ever called in sick when you weren't sick?"_
-   _"Have you ever stolen office supplies?"_

**Why it works:** These are things people _definitely_ do but would never admit to their boss. The stakes feel higher.

#### **The "Humble Brag":**

Confessions that sound bad but are actually flexes.

-   _"Have you ever been kicked out of a country?"_
-   _"Have you ever had someone write a song about you?"_
-   _"Have you ever been recognized in public?"_

**Why it works:** If someone says "yes," they're bragging. If they say "no," they might be lying to seem humble.

#### **The "Digital Dirt":**

Confessions related to online behavior and social media.

-   _"Have you ever stalked an ex on social media for over an hour?"_
-   _"Have you ever created a fake account to spy on someone?"_
-   _"Have you ever unfollowed someone because their posts were annoying?"_

**Why it works:** Everyone does this. The internet has made us all low-key stalkers.

#### **The "Relationship Red Flag":**

Confessions about dating, romance, and intimacy.

-   _"Have you ever ghosted someone after a first date?"_
-   _"Have you ever lied about your age on a dating app?"_
-   _"Have you ever snooped through a partner's phone?"_

**Why it works:** These are morally gray areas. The group will judge you either way.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Avoid illegal activities.** "Have you ever committed tax fraud?" isn't fun—it's a liability.
-   **Keep it relatable.** "Have you ever been to space?" is too niche.
-   **Make it recent.** "Have you ever used a rotary phone?" only works for older groups.
-   **Balance shame and humor.** The confession should be embarrassing, not traumatic.

### The "Spice Level" Modifier:

-   **Spice 1-2:** Wholesome confessions (crying at movies, talking to pets).
-   **Spice 3-4:** Mildly embarrassing (lying on resumes, social media stalking).
-   **Spice 5+:** Dark territory (relationship betrayals, morally questionable decisions).

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"Have you ever committed a felony?"_ (Too serious, not funny)
-   ❌ _"Have you ever been to Disneyland?"_ (Not embarrassing, no stakes)
-   ❌ _"Have you ever cheated on a partner?"_ (Too heavy, kills the vibe)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"Have you ever pretended to laugh at a joke you didn't understand?"_ (Universal, harmless)
-   ✅ _"Have you ever Googled 'how to tell if someone likes you'?"_ (Relatable, mildly embarrassing)
-   ✅ _"Have you ever lied about reading a book you never read?"_ (Common, funny)

## Game 3: Poison Pitch - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**"Would You Rather" Scenarios** - Two equally terrible options that force people to defend the indefensible.

### The Formula:

`"Would you rather [TERRIBLE OPTION A] OR [TERRIBLE OPTION B]?"`

### The Psychology:

This game works because of **cognitive dissonance**. Both options are bad, so the humor comes from watching someone try to rationalize their choice. The best cards make both options so horrifying that there's no "right" answer.

### Card Categories:

#### **The Physical Nightmare:**

Painful, disgusting, or dangerous scenarios.

-   _"Would you rather eat a live spider OR lick a subway pole?"_
-   _"Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck OR 100 duck-sized horses?"_
-   _"Would you rather have permanent hiccups OR always smell like garlic?"_

**Why it works:** These are visceral. People can _feel_ the horror of each option.

#### **The Social Suicide:**

Reputation-destroying choices that affect how others see you.

-   _"Would you rather drunk text your boss OR your ex?"_
-   _"Would you rather accidentally send a nude to your family group chat OR your work Slack?"_
-   _"Would you rather be known as 'the person who cries at work' OR 'the person who never washes their hands'?"_

**Why it works:** Social death is worse than physical pain. These cards attack your reputation.

#### **The Moral Dilemma:**

Ethically questionable choices that reveal your character.

-   _"Would you rather steal from a charity OR lie under oath?"_
-   _"Would you rather cheat to win $1 million OR play fair and lose?"_
-   _"Would you rather save your pet OR a stranger's child?"_

**Why it works:** These cards force people to reveal their values. The group will judge them either way.

#### **The Absurd Hypothetical:**

Scenarios so ridiculous that logic doesn't apply.

-   _"Would you rather fight a bear with a spoon OR seduce a bear with poetry?"_
-   _"Would you rather have fingers for toes OR toes for fingers?"_
-   _"Would you rather speak only in rhymes OR sing everything you say?"_

**Why it works:** The absurdity removes the pressure. People can be creative and silly.

#### **The "Forever" Curse:**

Permanent conditions that affect your entire life.

-   _"Would you rather never be able to use your phone again OR never be able to eat your favorite food again?"_
-   _"Would you rather always be 10 minutes late OR always be 20 minutes early?"_
-   _"Would you rather have to announce every time you fart OR have to ask permission every time you want to speak?"_

**Why it works:** The permanence raises the stakes. This isn't a one-time event—it's your new reality.

#### **The "Lose-Lose" Scenario:**

Both options are so bad that choosing feels impossible.

-   _"Would you rather have everyone you love forget you OR forget everyone you love?"_
-   _"Would you rather be able to read minds but never turn it off OR have everyone able to read your mind?"_
-   _"Would you rather live without music OR live without movies?"_

**Why it works:** These are genuinely difficult choices. The pitch becomes about damage control.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Balance the options.** If one option is clearly better, the game breaks. Both must be equally terrible.
-   **Make it visual.** "Fight a horse-sized duck" creates a mental image. "Experience discomfort" does not.
-   **Avoid trauma.** "Would you rather lose a parent or a sibling?" is too dark for a party game.
-   **Test for pitch-ability.** Can someone make a funny argument for either option? If not, rewrite.

### The "Spice Level" Modifier:

-   **Spice 1-2:** Silly, absurd scenarios (animal fights, weird superpowers).
-   **Spice 3-4:** Mildly embarrassing social scenarios (drunk texts, public mishaps).
-   **Spice 5+:** Dark moral dilemmas, sexual scenarios, or reputation-destroying choices.

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"Would you rather be rich OR be happy?"_ (Too philosophical, not funny)
-   ❌ _"Would you rather die by fire OR die by drowning?"_ (Too dark, not fun)
-   ❌ _"Would you rather have $1 million OR $500,000?"_ (One option is clearly better)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"Would you rather have a rewind button for your life OR a pause button?"_ (Interesting, debatable)
-   ✅ _"Would you rather always have to say what you're thinking OR never be able to speak again?"_ (Both options are terrible)
-   ✅ _"Would you rather fight Mike Tyson once OR talk like Mike Tyson forever?"_ (Funny, visual, balanced)

## Game 4: Fill-In Finisher - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Two-Part Prompts** - Sentences with two blanks where the Judge fills in the first blank (The Setup) and everyone else writes the second blank (The Punchline).

### The Formula:

`"[CONTEXT] _____ (Judge fills this), and now _____ (Others fill this)."`

### The Psychology:

This game is **collaborative improv**. The Judge sets the tone, and everyone riffs off it. The best prompts are open-ended enough to allow for multiple types of humor (dark, absurd, wholesome, sexual) but structured enough to guide the punchline.

### Card Categories:

#### **The Crime Scene:**

Prompts about getting in trouble, breaking rules, or facing consequences.

-   _"I got arrested for \_\_\_\_\_, and the cop said \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"I got kicked out of \_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_, and now I'm banned from \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"I got fired from my job for \_\_\_\_\_, and my boss told me \_\_\_\_\_."_

**Why it works:** Everyone fantasizes about getting away with something. These prompts let people live vicariously through chaos.

#### **The Breakup:**

Prompts about relationships ending, dating disasters, or romantic failures.

-   _"I broke up with my ex because of \_\_\_\_\_, and now they're dating \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"My Tinder date went wrong when they said \_\_\_\_\_, and I responded with \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"I got ghosted after I mentioned \_\_\_\_\_, and now I realize \_\_\_\_\_."_

**Why it works:** Relationship humor is universal. Everyone has a bad date story.

#### **The Job Interview:**

Prompts about professional disasters, workplace mishaps, or career failures.

-   _"I didn't get the job because I mentioned \_\_\_\_\_, and the interviewer said \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"My coworker got fired for \_\_\_\_\_, and HR sent an email about \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"I quit my job after my boss asked me to \_\_\_\_\_, and I told them \_\_\_\_\_."_

**Why it works:** Work is inherently absurd. These prompts tap into shared frustration with corporate culture.

#### **The Family Dinner:**

Prompts about awkward family moments, holiday disasters, or generational clashes.

-   _"Thanksgiving was ruined when someone brought up \_\_\_\_\_, and Grandma said \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"My parents found out about \_\_\_\_\_, and now they think I'm \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"Christmas dinner got awkward when my uncle started talking about \_\_\_\_\_, and my mom said \_\_\_\_\_."_

**Why it works:** Family gatherings are universally chaotic. These prompts let people vent through humor.

#### **The Public Embarrassment:**

Prompts about social failures, cringe moments, or public humiliation.

-   _"I embarrassed myself at \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_, and everyone saw \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"I accidentally said \_\_\_\_\_ in front of \_\_\_\_\_, and now they think I'm \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"I got caught \_\_\_\_\_ at \_\_\_\_\_, and the security guard said \_\_\_\_\_."_

**Why it works:** Public embarrassment is a primal fear. These prompts let people laugh at their worst nightmares.

#### **The Medical Mystery:**

Prompts about doctors, hospitals, or health-related disasters.

-   _"I went to the doctor for \_\_\_\_\_, and they diagnosed me with \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"The ER nurse asked me about \_\_\_\_\_, and I had to explain \_\_\_\_\_."_
-   _"I Googled my symptoms and found out I have \_\_\_\_\_, but the doctor said it's actually \_\_\_\_\_."_

**Why it works:** Medical humor is dark but relatable. Everyone has Googled their symptoms and panicked.

### Generation Rules:

-   **The first blank sets the tone.** The Judge's answer determines whether the round is dark, silly, or wholesome.
-   **The second blank is the punchline.** It should escalate, subvert, or callback to the first blank.
-   **Avoid forced connections.** The two blanks should flow naturally. "I ate \_\_\_\_\_ and now I'm \_\_\_\_\_" works. "I saw \_\_\_\_\_ and now I'm \_\_\_\_\_" is too vague.
-   **Test for versatility.** Can the prompt work with multiple types of humor? If it only works with one tone, it's too narrow.

### The "Callback" Technique:

The best punchlines reference the setup in unexpected ways.

-   **Setup:** "I got kicked out of Disney World for **punching Goofy**..."
-   **Good Punchline:** "...and now I'm banned from **all theme parks in North America**." (Escalation)
-   **Great Punchline:** "...and now I'm banned from **wearing costumes in public**." (Unexpected twist)
-   **Perfect Punchline:** "...and now **Goofy has a restraining order**." (Callback + absurdity)

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"I like \_\_\_\_\_ and I also like \_\_\_\_\_."_ (No stakes, no structure, boring)
-   ❌ _"I went to \_\_\_\_\_ and saw \_\_\_\_\_."_ (Too vague, no punchline potential)
-   ❌ _"My favorite \_\_\_\_\_ is \_\_\_\_\_."_ (Not funny, just a statement)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"I got banned from \_\_\_\_\_ for \_\_\_\_\_, and the manager said I was 'a threat to society'."_ (Clear stakes, room for creativity)
-   ✅ _"My therapist asked about \_\_\_\_\_, and I realized I need to talk about \_\_\_\_\_."_ (Relatable, allows for dark or wholesome humor)
-   ✅ _"I tried to impress my date by \_\_\_\_\_, but they just said \_\_\_\_\_."_ (Romantic failure, universal experience)

## Game 5: Red Flag Rally - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Dating Scenarios** - Cards with a **Perk** (something attractive) and a **Red Flag** (something horrifying) that people must defend.

### The Formula:

`"They're [ATTRACTIVE PERK], BUT [HORRIFYING RED FLAG]."`

### The Psychology:

This game exploits **cognitive dissonance** and **moral flexibility**. How much are you willing to overlook for money, looks, or status? The best cards create genuine internal conflict—the perk is _so good_ that you _want_ to ignore the red flag, but the red flag is _so bad_ that you can't.

### Card Categories:

#### **The Dealbreaker:**

Red flags so horrifying that no perk can save it.

-   _"They're a billionaire, BUT they don't believe in washing hands."_
-   _"They're a supermodel, BUT they think the Earth is flat."_
-   _"They own a private island, BUT they collect human teeth."_

**Why it works:** These cards test how much someone values money/looks over basic sanity. The Defender's job is nearly impossible, which makes it hilarious.

#### **The Negotiable:**

Red flags that are weird but manageable with the right argument.

-   _"They're hilarious, BUT they talk to their plants like children."_
-   _"They're incredibly smart, BUT they only eat chicken nuggets."_
-   _"They're great in bed, BUT they sleep in a race car bed."_

**Why it works:** These red flags are quirky, not dangerous. The Defender can spin them as "endearing" or "unique."

#### **The Trap:**

The perk is so good that you _want_ to overlook the red flag, but the red flag is genuinely concerning.

-   _"They're a doctor who will take care of you forever, BUT they're in a cult."_
-   _"They'll pay off all your debt, BUT they want you to quit your job and be a stay-at-home partner."_
-   _"They're your soulmate, BUT they have 47 cats."_

**Why it works:** These cards create real moral dilemmas. The group will be split on whether the perk is worth it.

#### **The Reverse:**

The "perk" is questionable, and the red flag makes it worse.

-   _"They're really into astrology, BUT they also think vaccines cause autism."_
-   _"They're a TikTok influencer, BUT they film pranks on homeless people."_
-   _"They're vegan, BUT they judge everyone who isn't."_

**Why it works:** Both parts are red flags. The Defender has to argue that _neither_ is a dealbreaker.

#### **The "Forever" Commitment:**

Red flags that affect your entire life, not just the relationship.

-   _"They're perfect in every way, BUT their family hates you and will never accept you."_
-   _"They want to get married immediately, BUT they also want 10 kids."_
-   _"They'll move anywhere for you, BUT they expect you to do the same for them."_

**Why it works:** These aren't just about the person—they're about the life you'd have with them.

#### **The Sexual Chaos:**

Red flags related to intimacy, attraction, or bedroom behavior (Spice 4+).

-   _"They're incredible in bed, BUT they insist on role-playing as historical figures."_
-   _"They're extremely attractive, BUT they want to film everything."_
-   _"They have a great body, BUT they only want to have sex in public places."_

**Why it works:** These cards are designed for groups comfortable with sexual humor. The absurdity makes them funny rather than uncomfortable.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Balance is everything.** If the perk is weak, the red flag must be mild. If the perk is strong, the red flag must be severe.
-   **Make the red flag specific.** "They're annoying" is boring. "They chew with their mouth open and make eye contact while doing it" is visceral.
-   **Avoid dealbreakers that are too serious.** "They're abusive" isn't funny—it's a genuine safety concern.
-   **Test for defend-ability.** Can someone make a funny argument for this person? If not, the card is broken.

### The "Spice Level" Modifier:

-   **Spice 1-2:** Quirky red flags (weird hobbies, odd habits).
-   **Spice 3-4:** Mildly concerning red flags (bad hygiene, annoying behaviors).
-   **Spice 5+:** Dark red flags (moral failures, sexual chaos, cult membership).

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"They're nice, BUT they're boring."_ (Weak perk, weak red flag, no stakes)
-   ❌ _"They're rich, BUT they're abusive."_ (Too serious, not funny)
-   ❌ _"They're attractive, BUT they have a job."_ (Not a red flag, makes no sense)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"They're a chef who will cook for you every day, BUT they only make food from the medieval era."_ (Strong perk, absurd red flag)
-   ✅ _"They're your celebrity crush, BUT they want you to join their pyramid scheme."_ (Dream perk, nightmare red flag)
-   ✅ _"They're independently wealthy, BUT they spend all their money on Funko Pops."_ (Great perk, embarrassing red flag)

## Game 6: Hot Seat Imposter - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Personal Questions** - Questions designed to expose how well the Imposter knows the Target.

### The Formula:

`"[QUESTION ABOUT THE TARGET'S LIFE/PERSONALITY/HISTORY]?"`

### The Psychology:

This game is about **social observation**. The best questions are things that:

1.  **The Target definitely knows** (it's about them).
2.  **The Imposter might know** (if they've been paying attention).
3.  **The group can verify** (so they can catch the Imposter).

The goal is to create questions that are specific enough to trip up a bad Imposter but vague enough that a good Imposter can bluff.

### Card Categories:

#### **The Softball:**

Easy questions that anyone could answer with basic knowledge.

-   _"What's your favorite food?"_
-   _"What's your biggest pet peeve?"_
-   _"What's your go-to karaoke song?"_

**Why it works:** These questions establish a baseline. If the Imposter gets these wrong, they're terrible at their job.

#### **The Curveball:**

Questions that require specific knowledge about the Target's recent life.

-   _"What did you do last Tuesday?"_
-   _"What's the last thing you bought online?"_
-   _"What's the last text message you sent?"_

**Why it works:** These questions are impossible to answer unless you've been stalking the Target. A good Imposter will make something up that _sounds_ plausible.

#### **The Trap:**

Questions designed to expose the Imposter by requiring hyper-specific knowledge.

-   _"What's the name of your childhood pet?"_
-   _"What's your middle name?"_
-   _"What's your biggest fear?"_

**Why it works:** These are facts that the Target knows instantly but the Imposter has to guess. If the Imposter hesitates, they're caught.

#### **The Roast:**

Questions that force the Imposter to insult or embarrass the Target.

-   _"What's your most embarrassing moment?"_
-   _"What's the dumbest thing you've ever done?"_
-   _"What's your worst habit?"_

**Why it works:** The Imposter has to balance accuracy (to fool the group) with cruelty (to make it funny). The Target will be judging them either way.

#### **The Hypothetical:**

Questions about how the Target would react in a specific scenario.

-   _"If you won the lottery, what's the first thing you'd buy?"_
-   _"If you could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, who would it be?"_
-   _"If you had to fight one person in this room, who would it be?"_

**Why it works:** These questions have no "right" answer, so the Imposter can be creative. The group votes based on whether the answer _sounds_ like something the Target would say.

#### **The "Only You Would Know":**

Questions that only the Target (and maybe their closest friends) would know.

-   _"What's your phone lock screen?"_
-   _"What's the last thing you Googled?"_
-   _"What's your most-played song on Spotify?"_

**Why it works:** These are verifiable facts. The Target can pull out their phone and prove the Imposter wrong.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Avoid yes/no questions.** "Do you like pizza?" is boring. "What's your favorite pizza topping?" requires a specific answer.
-   **Make it verifiable.** The group should be able to tell if the Imposter is lying based on their knowledge of the Target.
-   **Balance easy and hard questions.** Start with softballs, then hit them with curveballs.
-   **Avoid trauma.** "What's your biggest regret?" can get too heavy for a party game.

### The "Intimacy Scale":

-   **Surface Level:** Questions anyone could answer (favorite color, favorite movie).
-   **Friend Level:** Questions that require knowing the Target personally (recent activities, habits).
-   **Best Friend Level:** Questions that require deep knowledge (childhood memories, secrets).
-   **Soulmate Level:** Questions that only a partner would know (intimate details, private jokes).

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"Do you like dogs?"_ (Yes/no, too easy, boring)
-   ❌ _"What's your Social Security number?"_ (Too invasive, not fun)
-   ❌ _"What's your biggest trauma?"_ (Too heavy, kills the vibe)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"What's the weirdest thing in your search history right now?"_ (Specific, embarrassing, verifiable)
-   ✅ _"If you had to delete one app from your phone forever, which would it be?"_ (Reveals personality, debatable)
-   ✅ _"What's the last thing you cried about?"_ (Emotional, but not too heavy)

## Game 7: Text Thread Trap - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Text Message Scenarios** - Incoming text messages that are awkward, high-stakes, or emotionally loaded, designed to be answered in a specific Mandatory Tone.

### The Formula:

`"[SENDER]: [SHORT, AWKWARD TEXT MESSAGE]"`

### The Psychology:

This game exploits **social anxiety** and **tonal dissonance**. The humor comes from the mismatch between the message's context and the Tone the person must use. A "Seductive Whisper" reply to "Grandma is in the hospital" is objectively horrifying, which makes it hilarious.

### Card Categories:

#### **The "We Need To Talk":**

Relationship terrors, exes reaching out, or "who is this girl" texts.

-   _"Ex: Can we talk? I miss you."_
-   _"Partner: Who is Alex and why are they texting you at 2am?"_
-   _"Crush: I think we should just be friends."_

**Why it works:** These texts trigger immediate panic. Adding a bizarre Tone makes the panic comedic.

#### **The Corporate HR:**

Bosses asking for quick calls, unexpected firing rumors, or accidental "reply all" disasters.

-   _"Boss: Can you come to my office? We need to discuss something."_
-   _"HR: We received a complaint about your behavior at the holiday party."_
-   _"Coworker: Did you mean to send that email to the entire company?"_

**Why it works:** Work texts are inherently stressful. Responding in the wrong Tone is career suicide (but funny).

#### **The Family Tech Support:**

Boomer parents asking how to delete the internet or posting inappropriate statuses.

-   _"Mom: How do I delete Facebook? I think I got hacked."_
-   _"Dad: I accidentally posted a photo of my feet. How do I remove it?"_
-   _"Grandma: What is a 'meme'? Your cousin keeps sending me pictures of frogs."_

**Why it works:** Generational tech gaps are universally relatable. The absurdity of the questions makes them perfect for bizarre Tones.

#### **The Wrong Number:**

Bizarre requests from strangers (drug deals, cryptic warnings) that you must handle.

-   _"Unknown: The package is ready. Meet me at the usual spot."_
-   _"Unknown: I know what you did. We need to talk."_
-   _"Unknown: Is this the number for the pizza place? I need 47 pizzas delivered to the park."_

**Why it works:** Wrong number texts are inherently chaotic. Responding in a weird Tone escalates the chaos.

#### **The Group Chat:**

A chaotic thread where you are being roasted or asked to pick a side.

-   _"Group Chat: Why did you leave the party without saying goodbye?"_
-   _"Group Chat: We're voting on where to eat. You're the tiebreaker."_
-   _"Group Chat: Did you really say that about Sarah? She's in this chat."_

**Why it works:** Group chats are social minefields. One wrong message can ruin your reputation.

#### **The Emergency:**

High-stakes texts that require immediate, serious responses (which makes the Tones even funnier).

-   _"Mom: Your father is in the hospital. Call me."_
-   _"Roommate: The apartment is flooding. Where are you?"_
-   _"Friend: I'm stranded. Can you pick me up?"_

**Why it works:** These texts are genuinely serious, which makes responding in a ridiculous Tone even more absurd.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Keep it short.** The text should be 1-2 sentences max. Anything longer kills the pacing.
-   **Make it ambiguous.** The best texts can be interpreted multiple ways, allowing for creative responses.
-   **Avoid context overload.** "Your ex's new partner's cousin texted you about the thing from last week" is too complicated.
-   **Test for tonal flexibility.** Can this text work with _any_ of the 22 Tones? If only 2-3 Tones make sense, the card is too narrow.

### The "Stakes Spectrum":

-   **Low Stakes:** Casual texts from friends, minor inconveniences.
-   **Medium Stakes:** Work texts, family drama, social obligations.
-   **High Stakes:** Relationship crises, emergencies, legal issues.
-   **Maximum Stakes:** Life-or-death situations, career-ending moments.

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"Friend: Hey, what's up?"_ (Too casual, no stakes, boring)
-   ❌ _"Unknown: \[Long paragraph of context\]"_ (Too long, loses the pacing)
-   ❌ _"Lawyer: You're being sued for $10 million."_ (Too serious, not funny)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"Ex: I still have your hoodie. Want it back?"_ (Loaded question, multiple interpretations)
-   ✅ _"Boss: Are you available for a quick call?"_ (Immediate panic, works with any Tone)
-   ✅ _"Mom: We need to talk about your life choices."_ (Vague threat, universally relatable)

## Game 8: Taboo Timer - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Target Words + Forbidden Words** - A word the Clue-Giver must describe without using a list of related words.

### The Formula:

`"TARGET WORD: [Word to guess]"` `"FORBIDDEN: [5 related words that cannot be said]"`

### The Psychology:

This game exploits **linguistic constraints**. The forbidden words are always the _most obvious_ ways to describe the target word, forcing the Clue-Giver to think laterally. The best cards make the task feel impossible but are actually solvable with creativity.

### Card Categories:

#### **The Obvious:**

Common words where the forbidden words make it nearly impossible.

-   **TARGET:** _"PIZZA"_
-   **FORBIDDEN:** _Cheese, Italy, Slice, Delivery, Pepperoni_

**Why it works:** Everyone knows what pizza is, but describing it without these words requires creative thinking ("It's a flat circle of bread with toppings that you bake").

#### **The Abstract:**

Concepts that are hard to describe even _without_ forbidden words.

-   **TARGET:** _"LOVE"_
-   **FORBIDDEN:** _Heart, Feeling, Romance, Relationship, Emotion_

**Why it works:** Abstract concepts are already difficult to define. Removing key words makes it a genuine challenge.

#### **The Pop Culture:**

References that require creative clues to avoid forbidden words.

-   **TARGET:** _"HARRY POTTER"_
-   **FORBIDDEN:** _Wizard, Magic, Hogwarts, Wand, Book_

**Why it works:** Pop culture references are recognizable, but the forbidden words are the most direct clues. The Clue-Giver must use plot details or character names.

#### **The Oddly Specific:**

Niche words that require lateral thinking.

-   **TARGET:** _"SPATULA"_
-   **FORBIDDEN:** _Kitchen, Flip, Cook, Pancake, Utensil_

**Why it works:** The target word is specific, and the forbidden words eliminate all the obvious descriptions. The Clue-Giver must describe its shape or function indirectly.

#### **The Action/Verb:**

Words that describe actions, making them harder to mime or describe.

-   **TARGET:** _"RUNNING"_
-   **FORBIDDEN:** _Jog, Sprint, Fast, Exercise, Legs_

**Why it works:** Verbs are tricky because you can't just describe what something _is_—you have to describe what it _does_.

#### **The "Everyone Knows This":**

Universal experiences or objects that are easy to guess but hard to describe.

-   **TARGET:** _"BIRTHDAY"_
-   **FORBIDDEN:** _Cake, Party, Age, Celebrate, Candles_

**Why it works:** The target is simple, but the forbidden words are the first things anyone would say.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Choose 5 forbidden words.** Too few makes it too easy. Too many makes it impossible.
-   **Make the forbidden words obvious.** The goal is to force lateral thinking, not to trick the Clue-Giver with obscure words.
-   **Test for solvability.** Can someone describe the target word without using the forbidden words? If not, the card is broken.
-   **Avoid proper nouns as forbidden words.** "HARRY POTTER - Forbidden: Daniel Radcliffe" is too specific.

### The "Difficulty Scale":

-   **Easy:** Common words with obvious alternatives (e.g., "CAR - Forbidden: Drive, Vehicle, Wheels, Road, Gas").
-   **Medium:** Words that require creative descriptions (e.g., "OCEAN - Forbidden: Water, Sea, Blue, Fish, Waves").
-   **Hard:** Abstract concepts or niche words (e.g., "NOSTALGIA - Forbidden: Memory, Past, Feeling, Childhood, Remember").
-   **Expert:** Words where the forbidden words eliminate _all_ direct descriptions (e.g., "SILENCE - Forbidden: Quiet, Sound, Noise, Speak, Hear").

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"TARGET: DOG - FORBIDDEN: Animal, Pet, Bark, Puppy, Tail"_ (Too easy, too many alternatives)
-   ❌ _"TARGET: QUANTUM PHYSICS - FORBIDDEN: Science, Atom, Energy, Theory, Einstein"_ (Too niche, most people can't describe this anyway)
-   ❌ _"TARGET: LOVE - FORBIDDEN: Like, Adore, Care, Affection, Passion"_ (Forbidden words are synonyms, not descriptions)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"TARGET: WEDDING - FORBIDDEN: Bride, Groom, Ceremony, Ring, Dress"_ (Common event, but forbidden words are the most obvious clues)
-   ✅ _"TARGET: COFFEE - FORBIDDEN: Drink, Caffeine, Morning, Starbucks, Hot"_ (Universal, but requires creative descriptions like "bitter bean water")
-   ✅ _"TARGET: NIGHTMARE - FORBIDDEN: Dream, Sleep, Scary, Bad, Night"_ (Abstract, but solvable with phrases like "the thing that wakes you up in a panic")

## Game 9: The Unifying Theory - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Trios of Unrelated Items** - Three things that seem completely disconnected, forcing people to find a creative (or absurd) connection.

### The Formula:

`"[ITEM 1], [ITEM 2], [ITEM 3]"`

### The Psychology:

This game exploits **pattern recognition** and **creative reasoning**. The human brain is wired to find connections, even when none exist. The best trios are things that are _so different_ that the only way to connect them is through absurdity, dark humor, or lateral thinking.

### Card Categories:

#### **The "Visual Gag":**

Three things that look vaguely similar but serve different purposes.

-   _"A Cucumber, The Eiffel Tower, A Sword"_
-   _"A Traffic Cone, A Witch's Hat, A Dunce Cap"_
-   _"A Banana, A Boomerang, A Crescent Moon"_

**Why it works:** The connection is visual. People can say "They're all long and pointy" or "They're all yellow and curved."

#### **The "Social Hazard":**

Three people/groups you never want to meet.

-   _"Your Ex, The IRS, A Magician"_
-   _"A Telemarketer, A Jehovah's Witness, Your Landlord"_
-   _"A Clown, A Mime, A Ventriloquist"_

**Why it works:** The connection is emotional. "They all make you uncomfortable" or "They all show up uninvited."

#### **The "Impossible Reach":**

Three things so distinct it seems impossible to connect them.

-   _"The Moon, A Ham Sandwich, 9/11"_
-   _"A Dolphin, A Tax Return, The Color Purple"_
-   _"A Rubber Duck, The French Revolution, A Taco"_

**Why it works:** The absurdity forces people to get creative. "They all involve circles" or "They all end badly."

#### **The "Setup":**

Two innocent things and one terrible thing, forcing people to ruin the innocent things.

-   _"A Puppy, A Baby, A Serial Killer"_
-   _"Christmas, Your Birthday, A Funeral"_
-   _"A Rainbow, A Unicorn, A Colonoscopy"_

**Why it works:** People have to find a way to make the innocent things sound sinister to include the dark one.

#### **The "Pop Culture Mix":**

Three references from different eras or genres.

-   _"Shrek, Abraham Lincoln, A Roomba"_
-   _"Beyoncé, A Dinosaur, The Titanic"_
-   _"SpongeBob, The Bible, A Microwave"_

**Why it works:** The randomness makes it hilarious. "They all have yellow in them" or "They all involve water."

#### **The "Verb-Based":**

Three things connected by what they _do_ rather than what they _are_.

-   _"A Blender, A Tornado, A Politician"_
-   _"A Sponge, A Vampire, Your Mom"_
-   _"A Magnet, A Black Hole, Your Ex"_

**Why it works:** The connection is functional. "They all suck things in" or "They all destroy everything."

### Generation Rules:

-   **Make them visually distinct.** "A Cat, A Dog, A Hamster" is too easy. "A Cat, A Helicopter, The Concept of Time" is better.
-   **Avoid obvious connections.** "A Fork, A Spoon, A Knife" is boring. "A Fork, A Trident, Poseidon" is interesting.
-   **Test for multiple solutions.** The best trios have 3-5 possible connections, not just one.
-   **Balance absurdity and solvability.** If the trio is _too_ random, people will give up. If it's too easy, it's not fun.

### The "Spice Level" Modifier:

-   **Spice 1-3:** Connections should be clever, literal, or silly ("They're all round").
-   **Spice 4+:** Connections must be inappropriate, sexual, or dark ("They've all been inside someone").

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"A Car, A Truck, A Bus"_ (Too similar, no challenge)
-   ❌ _"Red, Blue, Green"_ (Too abstract, no visual or functional connection)
-   ❌ _"A, B, C"_ (Not even trying)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"A Priest, A Referee, A Zebra"_ (Visual connection: black and white. Dark connection: "If you see one running at you, you're screwed.")
-   ✅ _"A Cactus, A Porcupine, Your Ex"_ (Functional connection: "They're all prickly and painful to touch.")
-   ✅ _"The Moon, A Bald Head, A Bowling Ball"_ (Visual connection: "They're all smooth and round.")

## Game 10: Title Fight - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Fight Challenges** - Prompts that pit two people against each other in a battle of brains, body, or guts.

### The Formula:

`"[TYPE OF FIGHT]: [SPECIFIC CHALLENGE]"`

### The Psychology:

This game taps into **competitive instinct** and **social dominance**. The best challenges are:

1.  **Quick** (resolved in under 30 seconds).
2.  **Clear** (no ambiguity about who won).
3.  **Embarrassing** (the loser faces social consequences).

### Card Categories:

#### **The Brain (Categories):**

Rapid-fire back-and-forth where people name items in a category.

-   _"Category: Pizza Toppings"_
-   _"Category: Countries in Europe"_
-   _"Category: Disney Movies"_
-   _"Category: Things You'd Find in a Bathroom"_

**Why it works:** These are knowledge-based but accessible. Everyone knows _some_ pizza toppings, but under pressure, your brain blanks.

#### **The Body (Speed):**

Physical races to complete a simple task.

-   _"First person to touch a doorknob wins."_
-   _"First person to do 10 jumping jacks wins."_
-   _"First person to find something red wins."_
-   _"First person to take off their shoes wins."_

**Why it works:** These are pure reaction time. No strategy, just speed.

#### **The Soul (Guts):**

Tests of willpower, awkwardness, or endurance.

-   _"Staring contest. You cannot blink or smile."_
-   _"Compliment battle. First person to laugh loses."_
-   _"Hold your breath. First person to breathe loses."_
-   _"Arm wrestling. First person to give up loses."_

**Why it works:** These challenges are uncomfortable. The tension builds as people try not to crack.

#### **The Hybrid (Brain + Body):**

Challenges that require both thinking and physical action.

-   _"Name a country, then touch something that color. Repeat."_
-   _"Spell a word backwards while doing a handstand."_
-   _"Count to 20 in a foreign language while hopping on one foot."_

**Why it works:** Multitasking under pressure is hilarious. People will mess up immediately.

#### **The "Impossible" Challenge:**

Challenges that are technically possible but extremely difficult.

-   _"Say the alphabet backwards in under 10 seconds."_
-   _"Name 10 US presidents in chronological order."_
-   _"Do the Macarena perfectly from memory."_

**Why it works:** These challenges are designed to make both people fail, which is funny.

#### **The "Social Torture":**

Challenges that are embarrassing regardless of who wins.

-   _"Serenade the person to your left. Most convincing performance wins."_
-   _"Propose to a random object in the room. Best proposal wins."_
-   _"Impersonate someone in the room. Group votes on who did it better."_

**Why it works:** Even the winner looks ridiculous. The loser just looks _more_ ridiculous.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Keep it simple.** "Name a fruit" is better than "Name a fruit that starts with the letter corresponding to your birth month."
-   **Make it fast.** If a challenge takes longer than 30 seconds, it's too slow.
-   **Avoid equipment.** "First person to solve this Rubik's Cube" only works if you have a Rubik's Cube.
-   **Test for fairness.** "First person to dunk a basketball" is unfair if one person is 5'2" and the other is 6'8".

### The "Difficulty Scale":

-   **Easy:** Challenges anyone can do (touch a doorknob, name a color).
-   **Medium:** Challenges that require some skill (name 5 countries, do 10 push-ups).
-   **Hard:** Challenges that require specific knowledge or physical ability (name all 50 states, do a backflip).
-   **Expert:** Challenges that are nearly impossible (recite the Gettysburg Address from memory, hold a plank for 5 minutes).

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"First person to solve this calculus problem wins."_ (Too hard, not accessible)
-   ❌ _"First person to run a mile wins."_ (Too long, kills the pacing)
-   ❌ _"First person to guess my favorite color wins."_ (No skill, just luck)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"Category: Fast Food Chains"_ (Accessible, fast-paced, everyone knows some)
-   ✅ _"First person to find their phone wins."_ (Physical, quick, relatable)
-   ✅ _"Staring contest. No blinking, no smiling."_ (Simple, tense, hilarious)

## Game 11: Alibi Drop - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Crime Scenarios + 3 Mandatory Words** - Accusations that force people to create an alibi while secretly incorporating three random words.

### The Formula:

`"THE CRIME: [Accusation or suspicious scenario]"` `"MANDATORY WORDS: [Word 1], [Word 2], [Word 3]"`

### The Psychology:

This game combines **improvisation** and **deception**. The person must:

1.  Tell a convincing story.
2.  Hide three random words in the story.
3.  Make the words sound natural.

The best cards have crimes that are _specific enough_ to guide the story but _vague enough_ to allow creativity.

### Card Categories:

#### **The Suspicious Package:**

Scenarios where the person is caught with something they shouldn't have.

-   _"What is in this bag you're trying to sneak onto the plane?"_
    -   **MANDATORY WORDS:** _A Hamster, Glitter, The Declaration of Independence_

**Why it works:** The crime is clear (smuggling), but the mandatory words force absurdity.

#### **The Missing Person:**

Scenarios where the person must explain their whereabouts during a suspicious event.

-   _"Where were you the night your boss disappeared?"_
    -   **MANDATORY WORDS:** _Zumba Class, A Chainsaw, Gluten-Free Bread_

**Why it works:** The crime is serious, but the mandatory words make the alibi ridiculous.

#### **The Digital Evidence:**

Scenarios involving search history, texts, or online activity.

-   _"Why is your search history just 'how to hide a body'?"_
    -   **MANDATORY WORDS:** _A Shovel, A Pineapple, A Yoga Mat_

**Why it works:** The crime is incriminating, and the mandatory words must be woven into a plausible explanation.

#### **The Public Incident:**

Scenarios where the person caused a scene in public.

-   _"Why did security escort you out of the museum?"_
    -   **MANDATORY WORDS:** _A Kazoo, A Mannequin, Hot Sauce_

**Why it works:** The crime is embarrassing, and the mandatory words add layers of absurdity.

#### **The Relationship Betrayal:**

Scenarios involving cheating, lying, or sneaking around.

-   _"Why were you seen leaving your ex's apartment at 3am?"_
    -   **MANDATORY WORDS:** _A Toaster, A Map, A Parrot_

**Why it works:** The crime is emotionally loaded, and the mandatory words force creative explanations.

#### **The Financial Crime:**

Scenarios involving money, theft, or fraud.

-   _"Why is there $10,000 in cash hidden in your freezer?"_
    -   **MANDATORY WORDS:** _A Lottery Ticket, A Rubber Duck, A Cookbook_

**Why it works:** The crime is serious, but the mandatory words make the alibi sound like a fever dream.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Make the crime specific.** "Why are you suspicious?" is too vague. "Why is your trunk full of garden gnomes?" is specific.
-   **Choose random mandatory words.** The words should have _no_ logical connection to the crime. That's what makes it hard.
-   **Avoid impossible combinations.** If the mandatory words are "A Cloud, Infinity, The Concept of Time," the person can't incorporate them naturally.
-   **Test for story potential.** Can someone create a 30-second alibi using these words? If not, the card is broken.

### The "Word Selection" Strategy:

-   **One Concrete Noun:** Something physical and specific (e.g., "A Spatula").
-   **One Abstract/Weird Noun:** Something unusual or hard to work in (e.g., "A Tinder Profile").
-   **One Wildcard:** Something completely random (e.g., "The Declaration of Independence").

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"Why are you here? WORDS: Thing, Stuff, Item"_ (Too vague, no challenge)
-   ❌ _"Why did you rob a bank? WORDS: Gun, Mask, Money"_ (Words are too related to the crime, no creativity needed)
-   ❌ _"Why are you suspicious? WORDS: Love, Happiness, Joy"_ (Too abstract, can't be incorporated naturally)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"Why were you running from the police? WORDS: A Baguette, A Trampoline, A Tax Return"_ (Specific crime, random words)
-   ✅ _"Why is your car full of rubber ducks? WORDS: A Conspiracy Theory, A Smoothie, A Harmonica"_ (Absurd crime, absurd words)
-   ✅ _"Why were you banned from the library? WORDS: A Megaphone, A Pineapple, A Tuxedo"_ (Relatable crime, bizarre words)

## Game 12: Reality Check - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Self-Rating Prompts** - Questions that ask people to rate themselves on a specific trait, then compare their rating to the group's rating.

### The Formula:

`"Rating: [TRAIT OR ABILITY]"`

### The Psychology:

This game exploits **self-awareness** (or lack thereof). The best prompts are traits that:

1.  **Everyone thinks they're above average at** (Dunning-Kruger effect).
2.  **Are subjective enough** that the group can disagree.
3.  **Are embarrassing to be delusional about.**

### Card Categories:

#### **The Fighter:**

Physical abilities or toughness.

-   _"Rating: Your ability to win a bar fight against a random stranger."_
-   _"Rating: How long you'd last in a zombie apocalypse."_
-   _"Rating: Your pain tolerance."_

**Why it works:** Everyone overestimates their fighting ability. The group will humble them.

#### **The Lover:**

Attractiveness, charm, or romantic skills.

-   _"Rating: Your performance in the bedroom."_
-   _"Rating: How attractive you are on a scale of 1-10."_
-   _"Rating: Your ability to flirt."_

**Why it works:** These are deeply personal and subjective. The gap between self-rating and group rating is always hilarious.

#### **The Survivor:**

Practical skills or survival instincts.

-   _"Rating: How long you'd survive alone in the wilderness."_
-   _"Rating: Your ability to change a tire."_
-   _"Rating: How well you'd handle a home invasion."_

**Why it works:** Most people have never been tested in these scenarios, so they're guessing. The group knows better.

#### **The Liar:**

Deception, manipulation, or social skills.

-   _"Rating: How convincing you are when you lie."_
-   _"Rating: Your poker face."_
-   _"Rating: Your ability to keep a secret."_

**Why it works:** Liars always think they're better at lying than they are. The group has caught them before.

#### **The Genius:**

Intelligence, knowledge, or problem-solving.

-   _"Rating: Your overall intelligence."_
-   _"Rating: How good you are at trivia."_
-   _"Rating: Your ability to solve a Rubik's Cube."_

**Why it works:** Everyone thinks they're smart. The group will remind them of that time they couldn't figure out how to open a jar.

#### **The Social Butterfly:**

Charisma, humor, or likability.

-   _"Rating: How funny you are."_
-   _"Rating: How well-liked you are in this group."_
-   _"Rating: Your ability to make friends."_

**Why it works:** These are the most subjective traits. The gap between self-perception and reality is often massive.

#### **The "Oddly Specific":**

Niche skills or bizarre abilities.

-   _"Rating: Your ability to parallel park."_
-   _"Rating: How well you can hold your liquor."_
-   _"Rating: Your dance moves."_

**Why it works:** These are specific enough that the group has seen evidence. "You think you're a 9 at dancing? We saw you at Sarah's wedding."

### Generation Rules:

-   **Make it subjective.** "How tall are you?" is objective. "How intimidating are you?" is subjective.
-   **Avoid traits that are too serious.** "How good of a person are you?" is too heavy for a party game.
-   **Make it embarrassing to be wrong.** The gap between self-rating and group rating should be funny, not hurtful.
-   **Test for universality.** "Your ability to code in Python" only works if everyone in the group is a programmer.

### The "Delusion Scale":

-   **Mild Delusion (Gap of 2-3):** "I thought I was a 7, but I'm actually a 5." (Funny, not devastating)
-   **Moderate Delusion (Gap of 4-5):** "I thought I was an 8, but I'm actually a 3." (Hilarious, ego-crushing)
-   **Critical Delusion (Gap of 6+):** "I thought I was a 10, but I'm actually a 2." (Legendary, must finish drink)

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"Rating: Your height."_ (Objective, not subjective)
-   ❌ _"Rating: How good of a person you are."_ (Too serious, not fun)
-   ❌ _"Rating: Your ability to play the theremin."_ (Too niche, most people have never touched one)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"Rating: How funny you think you are."_ (Subjective, everyone overestimates this)
-   ✅ _"Rating: Your ability to handle your alcohol."_ (Testable, group has evidence)
-   ✅ _"Rating: How good you are at Mario Kart."_ (Specific, relatable, competitive)

## Game 13: Scatterblast - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Category + Letter Combinations** - A category (e.g., "Celebrities") and a starting letter (e.g., "J") that people must use to generate rapid-fire answers.

### The Formula:

`"CATEGORY: [Broad topic]"` `"LETTER: [Starting letter]"`

### The Psychology:

This game exploits **time pressure** and **mental blanking**. The best categories are:

1.  **Broad enough** that there are many possible answers.
2.  **Specific enough** that people can't just say random words.
3.  **Accessible enough** that everyone knows _some_ answers.

### Card Categories:

#### **The Pop Culture:**

Categories related to movies, TV, music, or celebrities.

-   _"CATEGORY: Celebrities / LETTER: J"_
-   _"CATEGORY: Disney Movies / LETTER: T"_
-   _"CATEGORY: Song Titles / LETTER: L"_

**Why it works:** Pop culture is universally accessible. Everyone knows _some_ celebrities or movies.

#### **The Geography:**

Categories related to places, countries, or cities.

-   _"CATEGORY: Countries / LETTER: S"_
-   _"CATEGORY: US States / LETTER: M"_
-   _"CATEGORY: Cities / LETTER: P"_

**Why it works:** Geography is taught in school, so most people know the basics. Under pressure, though, your brain blanks.

#### **The Food & Drink:**

Categories related to eating, drinking, or cooking.

-   _"CATEGORY: Pizza Toppings / LETTER: P"_
-   _"CATEGORY: Cocktails / LETTER: M"_
-   _"CATEGORY: Fast Food Chains / LETTER: B"_

**Why it works:** Food is relatable. Everyone eats, so everyone has answers.

#### **The Animals:**

Categories related to wildlife, pets, or creatures.

-   _"CATEGORY: Animals / LETTER: R"_
-   _"CATEGORY: Dog Breeds / LETTER: G"_
-   _"CATEGORY: Birds / LETTER: C"_

**Why it works:** Animals are easy to visualize, but under pressure, you'll forget every animal you've ever heard of.

#### **The Everyday Objects:**

Categories related to household items, tools, or common objects.

-   _"CATEGORY: Things in a Kitchen / LETTER: S"_
-   _"CATEGORY: Clothing Items / LETTER: J"_
-   _"CATEGORY: Tools / LETTER: H"_

**Why it works:** These are things people see every day, but naming them on the spot is harder than it sounds.

#### **The "Impossible" Letter:**

Categories paired with difficult letters (Q, X, Z).

-   _"CATEGORY: Countries / LETTER: Q"_ (Qatar, maybe?)
-   _"CATEGORY: Animals / LETTER: X"_ (X-ray fish? Xenops?)
-   _"CATEGORY: Foods / LETTER: Z"_ (Zucchini, ziti, and... uh...)

**Why it works:** These combinations are designed to make people struggle. The bomb will explode before they think of a third answer.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Avoid overly specific categories.** "Types of 18th-century French furniture" is too niche.
-   **Avoid overly broad categories.** "Things" is too vague.
-   **Test for answer density.** Can you name 10+ answers in this category with this letter? If not, it's too hard.
-   **Balance easy and hard letters.** "S" and "C" are easy. "Q" and "X" are hard.

### The "Chain" Variation:

Instead of a starting letter, the last letter of one answer becomes the first letter of the next.

-   _"CATEGORY: Animals"_
-   _"CHAIN: Dog → Giraffe → Elephant → Tiger → Raccoon..."_

**Why it works:** This adds an extra layer of difficulty. People must think ahead to avoid dead-end letters.

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"CATEGORY: Things / LETTER: A"_ (Too vague, infinite answers)
-   ❌ _"CATEGORY: Nobel Prize Winners in Physics / LETTER: R"_ (Too niche, most people can't name one)
-   ❌ _"CATEGORY: Colors / LETTER: Q"_ (Impossible, no valid answers)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"CATEGORY: Countries / LETTER: C"_ (Accessible, many answers: Canada, China, Colombia, etc.)
-   ✅ _"CATEGORY: Fruits / LETTER: B"_ (Easy but not too easy: Banana, Blueberry, Blackberry, etc.)
-   ✅ _"CATEGORY: Movie Titles / LETTER: T"_ (Pop culture, broad, many answers: Titanic, Toy Story, The Matrix, etc.)

## Game 14: Over/Under - Card Generation Guide

### What the AI is Generating:

**Numerical Questions About Someone** - Questions that have a specific number answer, allowing the group to bet on whether the real number is higher or lower than their guess.

### The Formula:

`"[QUESTION ABOUT THE SUBJECT THAT HAS A NUMERICAL ANSWER]"`

### The Psychology:

This game combines **social judgment** and **gambling**. The best questions are:

1.  **Verifiable** (the Subject can prove the answer).
2.  **Surprising** (the answer is often higher or lower than expected).
3.  **Revealing** (the answer says something about the Subject's personality or habits).

### Card Categories:

#### **Digital Dirt (Phone Checks):**

Questions that require the Subject to check their phone for an exact number.

-   _"Number of unread emails."_
-   _"Number of alarms currently set."_
-   _"Screen time usage for yesterday (in minutes)."_
-   _"Number of photos in your Camera Roll."_
-   _"Number of contacts in your phone."_

**Why it works:** These are instantly verifiable. The Subject opens their phone, and the truth is revealed.

#### **The Past (History):**

Questions about the Subject's personal history or life experiences.

-   _"Body count (sexual partners)."_ _(High risk, high reward)_
-   _"Age you had your first kiss."_
-   _"Number of times you've been arrested or detained."_
-   _"Number of jobs you've had in your life."_
-   _"Number of countries you've visited."_

**Why it works:** These questions are personal and often surprising. The group thinks they know the Subject, but they're usually wrong.

#### **The Hypothetical (Capabilities):**

Questions that test the Subject's abilities or knowledge in real-time.

-   _"How many push-ups can you do right now?"_ (Subject must perform)
-   _"How much cash is in your wallet right now?"_
-   _"How many state capitals can you name in 60 seconds?"_
-   _"How many digits of pi can you recite?"_

**Why it works:** These questions are testable on the spot. The Subject can't lie—they have to prove it.

#### **The Social Media:**

Questions about the Subject's online presence and activity.

-   _"Number of Instagram followers."_
-   _"Number of TikTok videos you've posted."_
-   _"Number of dating app matches (if single)."_
-   _"Number of Facebook friends."_

**Why it works:** Social media numbers are public (or semi-public), so the group can verify. They also reveal how "popular" or "active" the Subject is online.

#### **The Habits:**

Questions about the Subject's daily routines or behaviors.

-   _"Number of cups of coffee you drink per day."_
-   _"Number of hours you sleep per night (on average)."_
-   _"Number of times you've gone to the gym this month."_
-   _"Number of books you've read this year."_

**Why it works:** These questions reveal lifestyle choices. The group will judge the Subject based on the answer.

#### **The "Embarrassing Truth":**

Questions that are mildly embarrassing but funny.

-   _"Number of times you've watched your favorite movie."_
-   _"Number of selfies on your phone."_
-   _"Number of times you've Googled yourself."_
-   _"Number of plants you've killed."_

**Why it works:** These questions are lighthearted but revealing. The Subject's answer will either confirm or shatter the group's assumptions.

### Generation Rules:

-   **Make it verifiable.** "How many times have you lied?" is impossible to verify. "How many unread texts do you have?" is instant.
-   **Avoid questions that are too personal.** "How much money do you make?" can create genuine discomfort.
-   **Test for surprise factor.** If the answer is always predictable, the betting isn't fun.
-   **Balance high and low numbers.** "Number of hairs on your head" is too high. "Number of siblings" is too low (and boring).

### The "Line-Setting" Strategy:

The group must agree on a "Line" (the predicted number). A good Line:

1.  **Splits the room 50/50.** Half the group bets Over, half bets Under.
2.  **Is based on evidence.** "He posts on Instagram daily, so let's set the line at 500 followers."
3.  **Allows for debate.** "Wait, does he _really_ have 500 followers? I think it's lower."

### Bad Examples (and Why):

-   ❌ _"Number of thoughts you've had today."_ (Impossible to verify)
-   ❌ _"Number of siblings."_ (Too low, no betting tension)
-   ❌ _"Your annual salary."_ (Too personal, kills the vibe)

### Good Examples (and Why):

-   ✅ _"Number of unread text messages."_ (Instantly verifiable, often surprising)
-   ✅ _"Screen time usage yesterday (in minutes)."_ (Reveals phone addiction, group can debate)
-   ✅ _"Number of exes you still follow on Instagram."_ (Mildly embarrassing, verifiable, funny)

## Conclusion: The Art of the Perfect Card

Generating cards for party games is not about complexity—it's about **emotional leverage**. The best cards:

1.  **Are instantly understandable** (Drunk Person Test).
2.  **Create social tension** (judgment, competition, embarrassment).
3.  **Allow for creativity** (multiple valid answers or interpretations).
4.  **Are universally relatable** (avoid niche references).
5.  **Balance humor and stakes** (funny, not hurtful).

When in doubt, ask yourself:

-   **Would I want to answer this card in front of my friends?**
-   **Would this card make me laugh or make me leave the room?**
-   **Can someone who's three drinks in understand this immediately?**

If the answer to all three is "yes," you've created a perfect card.

Now go forth and generate chaos.
